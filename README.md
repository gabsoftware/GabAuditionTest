# GabAuditionTest

A medical utility to test your audition.

Just so you know:
* Most people stop hearing anything at arround 15000 Hz.
* Young children can often hear up to 20000 Hz.
* Left and right ears often have a different sensibility to frequencies.

Features:
* Test your audition from 16.3515625 Hz to 31608 Hz (10 octaves)
* Left ear, right ear, left & right ears, left then right ear tests
* Sine, square, sawtooth, triangle waves
* Note attack, sustain and release settings
* Volume control
* Save the generated sounds to files

Testing method:
* Use good earphones. I personally use Beyerdynamic DT-880 (5 to 35000 Hz range).
* Test mid frequencies first (arround 5000 Hz) to find the right volume!
